This is simple todoList with Zustand instead of Redux

The state manager Zustand allows you to easily manage the state of applications without complicating the development with a lot of code. You don't even need a provider to work, and the site is a ready-made hook. Moreover, the number of pages can be any.

The library comes with a nice set of out-of-the-box middleware, and also makes asynchronous stateful operations much worse.
